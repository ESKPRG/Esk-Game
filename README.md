# Esk-Game
The game project for the sixth-form students in esk.

Hello all, I have decided to name the game 'Byte' after 0 consideration. It'll get changed later but just to make it easier to talk about.
I am adding issues (improvments) as we move along, try to read the github documentation or guides on how to create pull requests, what they are for and all that good stuff, if you don't understand you can ask me. I will plan out stages for the development of the game and add it on discord and right here, so be sure to check from time to time. 

What is Byte?
Byte is a fully interactive, rts, dungeon crawler, rpg, browser game. The main premise of the game will revolve around Gods and highschool, and no it's not God of the Highschool for those wondering (Manhwa). As an rpg, the story and loot system will be quite extensive with a variaty of choices throughout the story and character selection/possiblities. The game will also have a Visual Novel system added for dialouges.

When is Byte?
I plan for something playable to be done by June.

Who is Byte?
It's a game.

Where is Byte?
Byte is in the browser or on mobile phones. I hope for the production of the mobile version to also get started soon.

Why is Byte?
Just cause. You know. Improving programming n' stuff.
